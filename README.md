# Blockchain Testing

A shallow dive into the world of Blockchain technology.

'Block.py' contains a Class that is called on 'main.py' - it allows you to see the difference in the hashed code if you make a manual change to the blocks

'App.py' is a bit more fun. It mimics the idea of making a transaction through a Python script. 

I signed up for a test account with Infura (A portal to the Etheruem network) I also signed up to Ganache using a Web3 binding. This allowed me to make a few fake transactions on the blockchain and physically see the results!
